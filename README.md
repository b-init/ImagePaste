## Configuring

### Customizing the save folder

By default, pasted images will be stored in a temporary folder, this one will be deleted when you close _Blender_. If you want, you can redirect these images to a different directory.
![Preferences - directory](assets/preferences/directory.png)

On the other hand, after you save the `.blend` file, these pasted images will be saved where the `.blend` file is located - in the `ImagePaste` folder. This folder can also be customized in the preferences.
![Preferences - subdirectory](assets/preferences/subdirectory.png)

### Customizing the image filename

![Preferences - filename](assets/preferences/filename.png)

You can customize the filename of the pasted image with the help of some predefined variables:

| Variable              | Description                                          | Example                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| `${yearLong}`         | Year with the century                                | 2021, 2022, …                  |
| `${yearShort}`        | Year without the century                             | 21, 22, …                      |
| `${monthNumber}`      | Month as a zero-padded decimal number                | 01, 02, …, 12                  |
| `${monthNameLong}`    | Full month name                                      | January, February, …, December |
| `${monthNameShort}`   | Abbreviated month name                               | Jan, Feb, …, Dec               |
| `${day}`              | Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number     | 01, 02, …, 31                  |
| `${weekdayNumber}`    | Weekday as a decimal number                          | 0, 1, …, 6                     |

| `${minute}`           | Minute as a zero-padded decimal number               | 00, 01, …, 59                  |

| `${index:N}`          | N-digits image order number with zero padding        | `${index:2}` gives 01, 02, …   |

The default filename is `${addonName}-${yearShort}${monthNumber}${day}-${hour24}${minute}${second}`.

### Choosing the image type to move when saving the file

![Preferences - image type](assets/preferences/image-type.png)

This feature will move (actually copy) images into the save directory after you save the file, so you can paste images anytime, no need to save it first. There's also an option in the add-on preferences you can choose the type of images to move:

- **Pasted images**: Only images that were pasted using the add-on would be moved to the save directory.
- **All images**: Images existing in the `.blend` file will be moved.
- **No moving**: Don't do anything when saving the file.

## Troubleshooting

If ImagePaste doesn't work, try:
- Running Blender as adminstrator
- Using an earlier version of ImagePaste, particularly [v1.4.0](https://github.com/Yeetus3141/ImagePaste/releases/tag/v1.4.0) and [v1.3.2](https://github.com/Yeetus3141/ImagePaste/releases/tag/v1.3.2) (Windows 7 doesn't seem to work with the newer versions)
